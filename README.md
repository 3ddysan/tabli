# Tabli - A Chrome Tab Manager

Tabli is my attempt to improve window and tab management in Chrome.

The popup can be used to quickly scroll through all open windows and tabs and switch to or close any open window or tab with a single click.  Tabli also supports saving and restoring sets of tabs.

You can learn more about Tabli by reading the [Tabli Intro](http://antonycourtney.github.io/tabli/) or [Usage Guide](http://antonycourtney.github.io/tabli/tabli-usage.html).
