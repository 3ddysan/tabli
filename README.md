# Tabli - A Chrome Tab Manager

Tabli is my attempt to improve window and tab management in Chrome. Tabli is a Chrome Extension that adds a *browser action* with a popup window to Chrome:

You can learn more about Tabli by reading the [Tabli Intro](http://antonycourtney.github.io/tabli/) or [Usage Guide](http://antonycourtney.github.io/tabli/tabli-usage.html).

The popup can be used to quickly scroll through all open windows and tabs and switch to or close any open window or tab with a single click.  Tabli also supports saving and restoring sets of tabs ( "Bookmarked Windows" ).

## Feedback

I welcome candid feedback, suggestions and bug reports. Please let me know your experience with Tabli, for better or for worse!
