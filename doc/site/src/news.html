           <h5>New Features:</h5>
           <ul>
             <li><b>Introducing: The Tabli Popout Window</b>&#8212; an independent Tabli window that
               updates as you browse. This provides a convenient, always-available view of all your
               browser windows and tabs, especially useful on large, high resolution monitors.
               Activate by clicking the popout
               <span style="white-space:nowrap">button (<img src="assets/popout.png"></img>)</span> in the Tabli popup.
             <li>Drag and Drop tab items in Tabli to move tabs between windows or re-order tabs within a window.</li>
             <li>Tooltips that show the full title and URL of each tab.</li>
             <li>Numerous bug fixes to address minor visual issues (like lingering visible-on-hover icons).</li>
             <li>Faster loading of FavIcons by using Chrome's built-in favicon cache, thanks to a contribution by John Bartel (@jonbo).</li>
             <li>Emacs-like keyboard shortcuts in addition to arrows (Ctrl-n, Ctrl-p / SHIFT-Ctrl-n/SHIFT-Ctrl-p to move to next/prev tab/window).</li>
             <li>A cleaned up toolbar.
           </ul>
           <h5>Permissions Warning and Privacy:</h5>
           <P>Unfortunately, existing users of the previous version of Tabli were greeted with this somewhat alarming
             dialog from Google Chrome after Tabli was automatically updated from the Chrome web store:
           <P>
             <img src="images/tabli-update-dialog.png"></img>
           <P>This dialog is rather misleading in that the only <em>new</em> permission added to Tabli between the previous
             version (0.8.8) and the latest version (0.9.1) is the ability for Tabli to read Chrome's store
             of FavIcons &dash; the small icons that appear on the tab for each web site.
           <P>Tabli requests the permissions shown in the above dialog in order to perform its essential function.
              However: <strong>Tabli does not make any outbound data connections, and does not send any data whatsoever
              to any external application, extension or cloud service.</strong>
           </P>
           <P>More detailed discussion may be found in the
           <a href="https://github.com/antonycourtney/tabli/issues/74">corresponding github issue</a>.
